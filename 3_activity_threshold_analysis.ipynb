    "#### The 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone is a rule by the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\n",

    "It set standards for air quality control / regulations. It starts with a summary statement:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"_SUMMARY: Based on its review of the air quality criteria for ozone (O3) and related photochemical oxidants and national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for O3, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is revising the primary and secondary NAAQS for O3 to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively._\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Monitoring ozone concentrations is therefore important to be able to inform the public about human health risk when the ozone levels are too high. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The EPA lists on their web page critical threshold levels for near-surface ozone concentratations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"_Based on extensive scientific evidence about the effects of ozone on public health and welfare, on October 1, 2015, EPA strengthened the ground-level ozone standard to 0.070 ppm, averaged over an 8-hour period. This standard is met at an air quality monitor when the 3-year average of the annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour average ozone concentration is less than or equal to 0.070 ppm_\" \n",

    "- Apply the learned Python data visualization functions to present the data, explore the main features of the time series and describe the interesting pattern that you can identify by the visual inspection of the data.\n",
